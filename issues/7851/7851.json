    "Description": "The single biggest issue with the Caster is that the network connections are all managed by one thread. This becomes a problem when one client loses connection and cannot disconnect gracefully. In some instances, the network socket thread will hang on one socket until it times out, which means none of the other clients get data for a bit.",
